Permit #: 856809

Approved Date: Nov 06, 2019

[FILER Oct 8, 2019 8:24 PM]: Amending to remove NPZs with service list and publishing. Southern NPZ will stay.; [RRC STAFF Oct 11, 2019 11:34 AM]: Distance to nearest lease line corrected.; [RRC STAFF Nov 6, 2019 11:17 AM]: We received a protest from Matthew Doss, who represents Timothy and Stefanie Delasandro. This department has had previous correspondence with the Delasandro’s in which the field rules were explained to them. Per the field rules an NPZ can be placed on the wellbore to show that there will be no productive wellbore within a SWR 37 distance to a lease, unit or internal tract line where the applicant does not have a mineral lease. On this application Chesapeake has placed an NPZ on the wellbore showing that there is no productive portion of the well within a SWR 37 distance to the tract the Delasandro’s have an interest in. Per the field rules they are not an affected party and not entitled to notification which was explained previously to them. We will take the intent to protest and convert this to a complaint action which will be forwarded to Docket Services for review and potential docketing.
